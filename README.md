# Teeny Tiny Compiler
This is just my code from following [this](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) awesome tutorial by Dr. Austin Henley.

I will probably make a few changes or add some stuff just to practice, but this is basically for me to figure out how lexers/parsers/emitters work in a language akin to pseudocode (Python) so that I can make one in Rust later.
